Few macros I wrote over time.
<br><br>
### Steering Wheel orientation
Reorients steering wheel to either base coordinate system or to current view (X and Y will lay "flat on screen")
<br><br>
### Replace model on draft
Replaces first model link of the draft with one that has same name as the draft file. Original model link file extension will be preserved
<br><br>
### Path tracer
Traces a path a **_point_** follows on draft when dimension(s) are changing. I've lost the code to this macro before finishing it, so it's wont to crash from time to time, can't deal with changing active documents and such
